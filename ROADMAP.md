# ROADMAP.md

## Release 1 — MVP (Current Priority)

**Goal:** Launch a paid, authenticated Service Desk with core diagnostic value.

### Must‑Have

* Welcome screen + Terms acceptance
* Authentication (Stripe‑based)
* Backend + database
* Case persistence (~30 days)
* Chat diagnostics
* Copy report button
* Voice‑to‑Text
* Attach photo (session‑only)
* Multi‑language support
* Mobile usability

### Nice‑to‑Have (if time permits)

* Reset / Clear current case
* Minor UI polish (colors, spacing)

---

## Release 2 — Productivity & Retention

**Goal:** Improve daily usage and reduce friction.

* Optional photo storage
* Case history management
* Clear history button
* Improved onboarding text
* UI theming polish
* Usage analytics
* Admin dashboard (internal)

---

## Release 3 — Advanced Workflow

**Goal:** Deeper integration with service operations.

* Structured report templates
* Diagnostic modes (HVAC, Electrical, Plumbing, etc.)
* Fleet / shop accounts
* Role-based access
* Advanced analytics

---

## Parking Lot / Ideas

* Emergency safety guidance (contextual)
* Offline-first mode
* Technician presets
* Company branding

(Items here are intentionally **not committed** to a release.)

## Guiding Rule

If a feature does not **directly help a technician finish a diagnostic faster**, it does not belong in Release 1.
