EXAMPLE OUTPUT:

Customer reports water pump not providing water flow to fixtures. Upon inspection, pump does not respond when faucets are opened. No operational noise or vibration detected from the pump unit.

Diagnostic checks performed: Verified 12V DC present at pump motor terminals under demand. Measured 12.4V at positive terminal with faucet open. Ground continuity confirmed between pump housing and chassis ground point. Resistance measured less than 0.5 ohms. Visual inspection revealed no corrosion or damage to wiring connections.

Water pump motor is not operating per specification. Unit receives proper voltage and has verified ground path but produces no response under load. Condition is not recoverable at unit level. Pump motor requires replacement.

Required repair procedure: Disconnect battery to isolate electrical system. Drain fresh water system through low-point drains. Disconnect inlet and outlet water lines from pump. Disconnect electrical connector from pump motor. Remove pump mounting hardware and extract pump from compartment. Install new pump in mounting location and secure with hardware. Reconnect inlet and outlet water lines with new clamps. Reconnect electrical connector. Restore battery connection. Fill fresh water system and prime pump. Verify operation at all fixtures and inspect for leaks.

Parts required: Water pump assembly, inlet hose clamp, outlet hose clamp, thread sealant tape.

Labor breakdown: System isolation and drainage - 0.2 hr. Pump removal including line disconnection - 0.3 hr. New pump installation and line reconnection - 0.3 hr. System fill, priming, and leak testing - 0.2 hr. Total labor: 1.0 hr.
